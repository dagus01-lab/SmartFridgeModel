Add the seasoned chicken and cook until browned on both sides and cooked through about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet and add the garlic. Cook until fragrant about 30 seconds. Stir in 1/2 cup of water and the lemon juice. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and set aside.\n"
